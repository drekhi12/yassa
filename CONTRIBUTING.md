# YASSA stands for "Yet Another System Setup Automation"

## Guidelines

* This repo is for beginners to intermediate developers and not aimed at Experienced developers. But feel free to contribute to it, if you feel like it.
* The main aim for this Repo is to automate some of the setups on different Operating Systems, be it environment setups or creating aliases etc.
* Pull the new changes first, check there is no duplicate content/scripts beforehand.
* To give everyone a fair shot, I will not be assigning the issues to individuals and the best script on the same topic will be priortized.
