# Welcome to YASSA!

**YASSA** stands for "Yet Another System Setup Automation". The main aim of this repo is to come up with automation scripts of any kind for different Operating systems, be it environment setups or creating good aliases to speed things up in the terminal.
The repo is going to be split into 3 main OS for now i.e. windows, mac and Linux for now.

 Things to keep in mind before raising a PR:
 * The script should be tested thoroughly.
 * Appropriate references should be added in the readme file to help others find the content easily.
 * Have fun with automation and let the creativity flow ðŸ˜Š
